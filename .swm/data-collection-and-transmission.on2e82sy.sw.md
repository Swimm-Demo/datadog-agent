# [Collecting Data](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/2dnbdkv4#collecting-data)

The Datadog Agent collects metrics, logs, and traces from various sources. This involves gathering data from different systems, applications, and services that are being monitored. The goal is to ensure comprehensive coverage of all relevant data points that can provide insights into the performance and health of the infrastructure.

# [Processing Data](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/2dnbdkv4#processing-data)

Once the data is collected, it needs to be processed to ensure it is in a format that can be easily analyzed. This step involves filtering, aggregating, and transforming the raw data into meaningful metrics and logs. The processed data should be structured in a way that makes it easy to visualize and interpret on the Datadog platform.

# [Sending Data to Datadog Platform](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/2dnbdkv4#sending-data-to-datadog-platform)

After processing, the data is sent to the Datadog platform. This step involves securely transmitting the data over the network to Datadog's servers. The data is then stored and made available for real-time monitoring and analysis. Users can access dashboards, set up alerts, and generate reports based on the data sent by the agent.
