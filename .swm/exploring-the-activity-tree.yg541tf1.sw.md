# Overview

The Activity Tree is a data structure that represents a process tree and its associated activities. It is used to monitor and analyze the behavior of processes within a system. The Activity Tree contains various nodes representing different types of activities, such as process nodes, file nodes, DNS nodes, socket nodes, and IMDS nodes. Each node type captures specific details about the activity it represents.

The Activity Tree is designed to be lock-free, meaning it does not use locks to manage concurrent access. This design choice helps to improve performance and reduce contention in multi-threaded environments.

The Activity Tree includes methods for inserting events, computing statistics, and generating graphical representations of the tree. These methods help to maintain and visualize the structure and content of the tree.

The Activity Tree also supports tagging nodes with image tags, scrubbing process arguments and environment variables, and differentiating arguments. These features enhance the tree's ability to provide detailed and accurate information about process activities.

# Inserting Events

The <SwmToken path="pkg/security/security_profile/activity_tree/activity_tree.go" pos="201:2:2" line-data="// AppendChild appends a new root node in the ActivityTree">`AppendChild`</SwmToken> method is used to append a new root node in the Activity Tree. This method helps in adding new process nodes to the tree.

```go
// AppendChild appends a new root node in the ActivityTree
func (at *ActivityTree) AppendChild(node *ProcessNode) {
	at.ProcessNodes = append(at.ProcessNodes, node)
	node.Parent = at
}
```

# Computing Statistics

The <SwmToken path="pkg/security/security_profile/activity_tree/activity_tree.go" pos="228:2:2" line-data="// ComputeActivityTreeStats computes the initial counts of the activity tree stats">`ComputeActivityTreeStats`</SwmToken> method computes the initial counts of the activity tree stats. This method is essential for analyzing the activities recorded in the tree.

```go
// ComputeActivityTreeStats computes the initial counts of the activity tree stats
func (at *ActivityTree) ComputeActivityTreeStats() {
	pnodes := at.ProcessNodes
	var fnodes []*FileNode

	for len(pnodes) > 0 {
		node := pnodes[0]

		at.Stats.ProcessNodes++
		pnodes = append(pnodes, node.Children...)

		at.Stats.DNSNodes += int64(len(node.DNSNames))
		at.Stats.SocketNodes += int64(len(node.Sockets))

		for _, f := range node.Files {
			fnodes = append(fnodes, f)
		}

		pnodes = pnodes[1:]
	}

# Generating Graphical Representations

The <SwmToken path="pkg/security/security_profile/activity_tree/activity_tree_graph.go" pos="8:4:4" line-data="// Package activitytree holds activitytree related files">`activitytree`</SwmToken> package holds files related to generating graphical representations of the Activity Tree. This helps in visualizing the structure and content of the tree.

```go
// Package activitytree holds activitytree related files
package activitytree

# Main Functions

There are several main functions in the Activity Tree. Some of them are <SwmToken path="pkg/security/security_profile/activity_tree/activity_tree.go" pos="176:2:2" line-data="// NewActivityTree returns a new ActivityTree instance">`NewActivityTree`</SwmToken>, <SwmToken path="pkg/security/security_profile/activity_tree/activity_tree.go" pos="201:2:2" line-data="// AppendChild appends a new root node in the ActivityTree">`AppendChild`</SwmToken>, <SwmToken path="pkg/security/security_profile/activity_tree/activity_tree.go" pos="228:2:2" line-data="// ComputeActivityTreeStats computes the initial counts of the activity tree stats">`ComputeActivityTreeStats`</SwmToken>, and <SwmToken path="pkg/security/security_profile/activity_tree/activity_tree.go" pos="154:4:4" line-data="// ActivityTree contains a process tree and its activities. This structure has no locks.">`contains`</SwmToken>. We will dive a little into these functions.

## <SwmToken path="pkg/security/security_profile/activity_tree/activity_tree.go" pos="176:2:2" line-data="// NewActivityTree returns a new ActivityTree instance">`NewActivityTree`</SwmToken>

The <SwmToken path="pkg/security/security_profile/activity_tree/activity_tree.go" pos="176:2:2" line-data="// NewActivityTree returns a new ActivityTree instance">`NewActivityTree`</SwmToken> function initializes a new instance of the Activity Tree. It sets up various properties such as the tree type, validator, paths reducer, and stats. This function is crucial for creating a new Activity Tree with the necessary configurations.

```go
// NewActivityTree returns a new ActivityTree instance
func NewActivityTree(validator Owner, pathsReducer *PathsReducer, treeType string) *ActivityTree {
	cache, _ := simplelru.NewLRU[cookieSelector, *ProcessNode](CookieToProcessNodeCacheSize, nil)

	return &ActivityTree{
		treeType:            treeType,
		validator:           validator,
		pathsReducer:        pathsReducer,
		Stats:               NewActivityTreeNodeStats(),
		CookieToProcessNode: cache,
		SyscallsMask:        make(map[int]int),
		DNSNames:            utils.NewStringKeys(nil),
	}
}
