# Overview

The Forwarder is responsible for sending payloads to the backend. These payloads can come from various sources and in different formats, but the Forwarder does not inspect them. It can handle multiple domains, each with a list of API keys. Every payload is sent to each domain/API key pair, creating what is known as a 'Transaction'.

# Transaction Handling

Transactions are retried on error, with the newest transactions being retried first. These transactions are processed asynchronously by Workers.

# Components of the Forwarder

The Forwarder is composed of multiple parts, including the <SwmToken path="comp/forwarder/defaultforwarder/endpoints/endpoints.go" pos="10:17:17" line-data="import &quot;github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/comp/forwarder/defaultforwarder/transaction&quot;">`defaultforwarder`</SwmToken>, domainForwarder, Worker, and blockedEndpoints, each playing a specific role in the payload forwarding process.

# Usage

To use the Forwarder, you need to initialize it with a map of domains and their corresponding API keys. Then, set the number of workers and start the Forwarder.
