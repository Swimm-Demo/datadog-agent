# [Identifying the Data Source](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/xdbdnedz#identify-data-source)

The first step in adding a new data source is to identify the type of data you want to collect. This could be metrics, logs, or traces from various systems such as servers, databases, or applications. Understanding the type of data helps in configuring the appropriate settings later.

# [Configuring the Data Source](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/xdbdnedz#configure-data-source)

Once the data source is identified, the next step is to configure it. This involves setting up the necessary parameters such as the data source's endpoint, authentication details, and any specific metrics or logs you want to collect. Proper configuration ensures that the data is collected accurately and efficiently.

# [Validating the Data Source](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/xdbdnedz#validate-data-source)

After configuring the data source, it is crucial to validate the setup. This involves checking if the data is being collected as expected and if there are any errors or issues. Validation helps in ensuring that the data source is correctly integrated and functioning as intended.

# [Sending Data to Datadog](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/xdbdnedz#send-data-to-datadog)

The final step is to send the collected data to the Datadog platform. This involves setting up the Datadog Agent to transmit the data securely and efficiently. Once the data is sent, it can be monitored and analyzed on the Datadog platform, providing valuable insights and metrics.
