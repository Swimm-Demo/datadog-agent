title: Starting the DogStatsD Server
---
This document will cover the process of starting the <SwmToken path="tasks/flavor.py" pos="9:1:1" line-data="    dogstatsd = 4">`dogstatsd`</SwmToken> server, which includes:

1. Initiating the server
2. Setting up various listeners
3. Handling packets
4. Processing incoming messages.

# [Initiating the DogStatsD Server](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/l26h1x7z#starthook)

The process begins with initiating the <SwmToken path="tasks/flavor.py" pos="9:1:1" line-data="    dogstatsd = 4">`dogstatsd`</SwmToken> server. This step involves calling the start function and logging whether the server started successfully or encountered an error. This is crucial for ensuring that the server is up and running before proceeding to the next steps.

# [Setting up Various Listeners](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/l26h1x7z#start)

Once the server is initiated, the next step is to set up various listeners based on the configuration. These listeners can include UDP, UDS, and named pipes. Each listener is responsible for receiving data packets from different sources. The configuration determines which listeners are initialized, ensuring that the server can handle data from multiple input methods.

# [Handling Packets](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/l26h1x7z#handling-packets)

After setting up the listeners, the server needs to handle incoming packets. This involves setting up packet forwarding if a forward host and port are configured. A new channel for packets is created, and a forwarder goroutine is started to manage the forwarding process. This ensures that packets are efficiently routed to their intended destinations.

# [Processing Incoming Messages](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/l26h1x7z#handlemessages)

The final step in starting the <SwmToken path="tasks/flavor.py" pos="9:1:1" line-data="    dogstatsd = 4">`dogstatsd`</SwmToken> server is processing incoming messages. This involves initializing and running worker goroutines that handle the packets read from the listeners. The number of workers can be configured to optimize performance based on the server's workload. This step ensures that all incoming data is processed promptly and accurately.
