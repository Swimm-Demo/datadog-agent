This document will cover the flow of generating content from templates, which includes:

1. Parsing the input files
2. Generating content based on templates
3. Handling specifications recursively
4. Looking up symbols
5. Performing gateway lookups.

# [Parsing the Input Files](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/eq2sj0rb#parsing-the-file)

The process begins by reading and understanding the input files, which include model and types files. These files contain the necessary data structures and types that will be used throughout the flow. The system initializes the configuration for parsing and creates an abstract syntax tree (AST) from these files. This step is crucial as it sets up a module structure to hold the parsed data, ensuring that all subsequent steps have the necessary information to work with.

# [Generating Content Based on Templates](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/eq2sj0rb#generatecontent-function)

Once the input files are parsed successfully, the next step is to generate content based on predefined templates. This involves using the parsed data to fill in the templates, creating various outputs. These templates are designed to produce different types of content, such as documentation or code snippets, which are essential for the end-user. The generated content is then formatted and written to temporary files, ensuring that the output is clean and ready for use.

# [Handling Specifications Recursively](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/eq2sj0rb#handling-specifications-recursively)

This step involves processing each field in the module's specification. The system handles embedded structures, parses field tags, and updates the module's metadata accordingly. This recursive handling ensures that all nested structures and fields are processed and included in the module's representation. This step is vital for maintaining the integrity and completeness of the data, which directly impacts the accuracy of the generated content.

# [Looking Up Symbols](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/eq2sj0rb#looking-up-symbols)

During the recursive handling of specifications, it is often necessary to resolve references to other types and structures. The system performs symbol lookups within the parsed AST files to locate these references. This ensures that all dependencies are correctly identified and included in the final output, providing a comprehensive and interconnected representation of the data.

# [Performing Gateway Lookups](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/eq2sj0rb#performing-gateway-lookup)

The final step involves performing gateway lookups for connection statistics. This process determines the destination address for the lookup and retrieves the necessary gateway information. The system checks the route cache for existing entries and, if necessary, retrieves subnet information for the gateway. This ensures that the gateway information is accurately resolved and cached for future lookups, optimizing the performance and reliability of the system.
