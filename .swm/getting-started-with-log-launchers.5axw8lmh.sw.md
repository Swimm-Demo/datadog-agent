# Overview of Launchers

Launchers are responsible for translating sources (<SwmToken path="pkg/logs/launchers/types.go" pos="40:14:16" line-data="	SubscribeForType(sourceType string) (added chan *sources.LogSource, removed chan *sources.LogSource)">`sources.LogSource`</SwmToken>) to tailers and managing their lifecycle. The logs agent maintains a set of current launchers, starting and stopping them at startup and stopping them when the <SwmToken path="pkg/logs/launchers/types.go" pos="18:12:14" line-data="// Launchers are started when the logs-agent starts, or when they are added to">`logs-agent`</SwmToken> stops.

# Implementation of Launchers

Launchers are implemented in sub-packages of <SwmPath>[pkg/logs/launchers/](pkg/logs/launchers/)</SwmPath>. They are responsible for creating tailers, which contain pipelines. Each launcher filters the sources, usually based on `source.Config.Type`, which comes from the <SwmToken path="pkg/logs/launchers/launchers.go" pos="19:0:0" line-data="type Launchers struct {">`type`</SwmToken> key in `logs_config` sections.

# Example of a Launcher

Several Launchers are quite simple, translating sources into tailers. For example, the file launcher handles wild-card filenames and logfile rotation by creating multiple tailers for each source.

# Main Functions

There are several main functions in this folder. Some of them are translating sources to tailers and managing tailers' lifecycle. We will dive a little into translating sources to tailers and managing tailers' lifecycle.

## Translating Sources to Tailers

Launchers are responsible for translating sources (<SwmToken path="pkg/logs/launchers/types.go" pos="40:14:16" line-data="	SubscribeForType(sourceType string) (added chan *sources.LogSource, removed chan *sources.LogSource)">`sources.LogSource`</SwmToken>) to tailers. This involves taking the log sources and creating tailers that can read and process the logs from these sources.

## Managing Tailers' Lifecycle

Launchers manage the lifecycle of tailers, which includes starting and stopping them. The logs agent maintains a set of current launchers, starting them at startup and stopping them when the <SwmToken path="pkg/logs/launchers/types.go" pos="18:12:14" line-data="// Launchers are started when the logs-agent starts, or when they are added to">`logs-agent`</SwmToken> stops.
