The 'Show Security Profiles' command allows users to display the content of a security profile file. This is useful for reviewing the details of a specific security profile.

# [List Security Profiles](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/zy90fnct#listsecurityprofilecommands)

The 'List Security Profiles' command provides a list of active security profiles. This helps users keep track of which profiles are currently in use.

# [Save Security Profiles](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/zy90fnct#savesecurityprofilecommands)

The 'Save Security Profiles' command allows users to save a security profile to disk. This is useful for preserving the current state of a security profile for future use.

# [Activity Dumps Management](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/zy90fnct#activitydumpcommands)

The 'Activity Dumps Management' section includes commands for generating, listing, stopping, and computing differences between activity dumps. This helps users monitor and analyze security-related activities.

# [Generate Activity Dumps](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/zy90fnct#generatecommands)

The 'Generate Activity Dumps' command allows users to create activity dumps. This is useful for capturing and analyzing security-related activities over a period of time.

# [List Activity Dumps](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/zy90fnct#listcommands)
