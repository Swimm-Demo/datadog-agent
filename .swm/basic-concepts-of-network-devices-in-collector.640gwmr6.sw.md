# Overview

Network devices refer to the various hardware components within an <SwmToken path="pkg/collector/corechecks/network-devices/cisco-sdwan/client/client.go" pos="171:14:16" line-data="// GetDevices get all devices from this SD-WAN network">`SD-WAN`</SwmToken> network that are monitored and managed by the Datadog Agent. This document explains the basic concepts of network devices in the collector, including retrieving devices, fetching device counters, building device metadata, generating device tags, calculating device uptime, and determining device status.

# Retrieving Devices

func (client *Client) GetDevices() ([]Device, error) {
	devices, err := getAllEntries[Device](client, "/dataservice/device", nil)
	if err != nil {
