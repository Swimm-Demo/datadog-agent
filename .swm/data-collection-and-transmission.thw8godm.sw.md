# [Collecting Data](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/jkg25wrv#collecting-data)

The Datadog Agent collects metrics, logs, and traces from various sources. This involves gathering data from different systems, applications, and services that are being monitored. The goal is to ensure comprehensive coverage of all relevant data points to provide a holistic view of the system's performance and health.

# [Processing Data](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/jkg25wrv#processing-data)

Once the data is collected, it needs to be processed to ensure it is in a format suitable for analysis. This step involves filtering, aggregating, and transforming the raw data into meaningful metrics and logs. The processing ensures that only relevant and actionable data is sent to the Datadog platform, optimizing both performance and storage.

# [Sending Data to Datadog Platform](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/jkg25wrv#sending-data-to-datadog-platform)

After processing, the data is sent to the Datadog platform. This step involves securely transmitting the processed metrics, logs, and traces to Datadog's servers. The data is then available for real-time monitoring, alerting, and analysis, enabling users to gain insights into their system's performance and quickly identify and resolve issues.
