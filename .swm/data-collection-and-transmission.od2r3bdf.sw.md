# [Collecting Data](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/6k1zellh#collecting-data)

The Datadog Agent collects metrics, logs, and traces from various sources. This involves gathering data from different systems, applications, and services that are being monitored. The goal is to ensure comprehensive coverage of all relevant data points for monitoring and analysis.

# [Processing Data](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/6k1zellh#processing-data)

Once the data is collected, it needs to be processed to ensure it is in a format suitable for analysis. This includes filtering out irrelevant data, aggregating data points, and converting data into a standardized format. The processing step is crucial for maintaining data quality and ensuring accurate monitoring results.

# [Sending Data to Datadog Platform](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/6k1zellh#sending-data-to-datadog-platform)

After processing, the data is sent to the Datadog platform. This involves transmitting the data over the network to Datadog's servers where it can be stored, analyzed, and visualized. The goal is to provide users with real-time insights and alerts based on the collected data.
