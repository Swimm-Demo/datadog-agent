# [Defining the eBPF Compiler](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/kkpdtulq#defining-the-ebpf-compiler)

The first step in setting up the eBPF compiler involves defining the necessary variables and rules. This includes configuring the target architecture and eBPF build flags, and retrieving the kernel headers. The goal is to ensure that the eBPF programs are compiled correctly. This step is crucial for setting up the environment in which the eBPF programs will be built, ensuring compatibility with the target architecture and kernel version.

# [Getting Kernel Header Flags](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/kkpdtulq#getting-kernel-header-flags)

The next step is to generate a list of flags for the kernel headers. This involves calling a function to retrieve the directories of the Linux headers and formatting them into flags. These flags are essential for the compiler to locate the necessary kernel headers during the build process.

# [Getting Linux Header Directories](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/kkpdtulq#getting-linux-header-directories)

This step involves retrieving the paths to the Linux header directories based on the provided kernel release, minimal kernel release, and architecture. The function searches common directories and filters them based on the criteria. This ensures that the correct headers are used for the target kernel version and architecture.
