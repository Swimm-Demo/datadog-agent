# [Initiating the Intake Loop](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/eyf1uiaa#listen)

The Listen functionality begins by initiating the intake loop for the UDSStreamListener. This process runs in its own separate thread, ensuring that the main process is not blocked. The intake loop is responsible for starting the connection tracker and preparing the system to accept incoming Unix connections.

# [Handling Incoming Connections](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/eyf1uiaa#listen)

Once the intake loop is initiated, the system starts to accept incoming Unix connections. For each connection, a new thread is created to handle it. This approach allows multiple connections to be managed simultaneously without blocking the main process. The connection tracker is also started to keep track of all active connections, ensuring that each connection is properly monitored and managed.

# [Managing Multiple Connections Simultaneously](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/eyf1uiaa#listen)

To manage multiple connections simultaneously, the system creates a new thread for each incoming connection. This ensures that the main process remains unblocked and can continue to accept new connections. The connection tracker plays a crucial role in this process by keeping track of all active connections and ensuring that each connection is properly handled. This approach allows the system to efficiently manage a large number of connections without performance degradation.
