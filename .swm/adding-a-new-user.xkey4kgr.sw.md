# [Collecting User Information](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/k67ap7vu#collect-user-info)

The first step in adding a new user involves collecting all necessary information from the user. This includes details such as the user's name, email address, and any other relevant data required for their profile. This information is typically gathered through a user interface where the user inputs their details.

# [Validating User Information](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/k67ap7vu#validate-user-info)

Once the user information is collected, it needs to be validated to ensure accuracy and completeness. This involves checking that all required fields are filled out, the email address is in the correct format, and any other specific validation rules are met. This step is crucial to prevent errors and ensure the integrity of the data.

# [Storing User Information](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/k67ap7vu#store-user-info)

After validation, the user information is stored in the system's database. This allows the system to keep a record of the user and their details, which can be accessed and used for various purposes such as authentication, personalization, and communication.

# [Confirming User Addition](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/k67ap7vu#confirm-user-addition)

The final step is to confirm the addition of the new user. This typically involves sending a confirmation message to the user, such as an email, to inform them that their account has been successfully created. This step ensures that the user is aware of their new account and can start using the system.
