# [Collecting Data](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/5r1i4p8o#collecting-data)

The Datadog Agent collects metrics, logs, and traces from various sources. This involves gathering data from different systems, applications, and services that are being monitored. The goal is to ensure comprehensive coverage of all relevant data points to provide a holistic view of the system's performance and health.

# [Processing Data](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/5r1i4p8o#processing-data)

Once the data is collected, it needs to be processed to ensure it is in a format that can be easily analyzed. This involves filtering, aggregating, and transforming the data as necessary. The processing step is crucial for removing any noise and ensuring that only relevant and actionable data is sent to the Datadog platform.

# [Sending Data to Datadog Platform](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/5r1i4p8o#sending-data-to-datadog-platform)

After processing, the data is sent to the Datadog platform. This step involves securely transmitting the data over the network to Datadog's servers. The data is then available for real-time monitoring and analysis, allowing users to gain insights into their system's performance and health.
