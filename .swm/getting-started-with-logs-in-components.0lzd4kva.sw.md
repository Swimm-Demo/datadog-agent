# Getting Started with Logs in Components

Logs refer to the data collected by the logs-agent, which is then submitted to Datadog's infrastructure for further analysis and monitoring. The logs-agent processes and sends logs to the backend, ensuring that logs are collected from various sources and transmitted efficiently.

## Agent Structure

The logs-agent has two main components: determining what to log and managing the mechanics of logging. It includes components such as tailers, decoders, processors, and senders, which work together to handle the logging process.

## Auditor

The logs-agent includes an auditor that tracks successful message transmissions and helps manage message re-transmissions after an agent restart.

## Logs Endpoints

Logs endpoints are crucial for transmitting logs to the backend. The logs-agent supports both HTTP and TCP endpoints.
