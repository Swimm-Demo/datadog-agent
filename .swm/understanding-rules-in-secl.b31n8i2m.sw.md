# Overview

Rules in SECL (Security Event Correlation Language) are defined as part of a policy file. A policy file is composed of a list of rules and macros. Each rule has an ID, expression, and other attributes that define its behavior and scope.

Rules are grouped into a <SwmToken path="pkg/security/secl/rules/ruleset.go" pos="182:2:2" line-data="// RuleSet holds a list of rules, grouped in bucket. An event can be evaluated">`RuleSet`</SwmToken>, which holds a list of rules and can evaluate events against these rules.

# Policy Struct

The <SwmToken path="pkg/security/secl/rules/ruleset.go" pos="189:6:6" line-data="	policies         []*Policy">`Policy`</SwmToken> struct represents a policy file which is composed of a list of rules and macros. This struct is essential for defining and managing rules within the system.

# Adding Rules

The <SwmToken path="pkg/security/secl/rules/policy.go" pos="44:2:2" line-data="// AddRule adds a rule to the policy">`AddRule`</SwmToken> function adds a rule to the policy. This function links the rule to the policy and appends it to the list of rules.

The <SwmToken path="pkg/security/secl/rules/policy.go" pos="44:2:2" line-data="// AddRule adds a rule to the policy">`AddRule`</SwmToken> function is defined here, showing how it appends a rule to the policy's list of rules.

```go
// AddRule adds a rule to the policy
func (p *Policy) AddRule(def *RuleDefinition) {
	def.Policy = p
	p.Rules = append(p.Rules, def)
}
```

# Evaluating Rules

Rules are evaluated using an evaluator that checks if the event matches the rule's expression. If the rule matches, it can trigger actions or notify listeners.

# Combining and Overriding Rules

Rules can be combined using different policies, and they can be overridden by other rules. This allows for flexible and dynamic rule management.

# Approvers

Rules can also have approvers, which are filter values indexed by field. Approvers are used to determine if a rule can be applied to a specific event.

# Main Functions

There are several main functions in this folder. Some of them are <SwmToken path="pkg/security/secl/rules/ruleset.go" pos="73:2:2" line-data="// MergeWith merges macro m2 into m">`MergeWith`</SwmToken>, <SwmToken path="pkg/security/secl/rules/ruleset.go" pos="117:2:2" line-data="// GetTag returns the tag value associated with a tag key">`GetTag`</SwmToken>, and <SwmToken path="pkg/security/secl/rules/ruleset.go" pos="218:2:2" line-data="// GetRules returns the active rules">`GetRules`</SwmToken>.
