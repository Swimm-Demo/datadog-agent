This document will cover the process of starting components and servers within the Datadog Agent. We'll cover:

1. Initializing configurations
2. Setting up servers
3. Handling incoming messages.

# [Initializing configurations](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/e4oapmt0#initialization)

The initialization step involves setting up the necessary configurations for the OTLPReceiver. This includes configuring the gRPC server if it is set to be active. The server is then registered and started to listen for incoming connections. This step ensures that the server is ready to handle incoming data efficiently.

# [Setting up servers](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/e4oapmt0#newserver)

Setting up servers involves creating and initializing various servers required by the Datadog Agent. For example, the <SwmToken path="tasks/flavor.py" pos="9:1:1" line-data="    dogstatsd = 4">`dogstatsd`</SwmToken> server is set up by calling the `NewServerlessServer` function, which configures the server with the necessary components and starts it. This step is crucial for ensuring that the servers are ready to handle incoming data and perform their respective tasks.

# [Handling incoming messages](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/e4oapmt0#message-handling)

Handling incoming messages is a critical step where the server processes incoming packets. This involves starting the statistics processing, initializing listeners, and spawning worker goroutines to handle the packets. This step ensures that the incoming data is processed efficiently and accurately, providing real-time monitoring and analysis capabilities.
