title: Populating Status Map
---
This document will cover the process of populating a status map with hostname statistics and metadata. We'll cover:

1. Initiating the JSON function
2. Populating the status map
3. Retrieving data from the cache
4. Building a metadata payload.

# [Initiating the JSON function](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/t4ea8fl6#json)

The process begins with the JSON function. This function is responsible for initiating the population of the status map. It calls another function to fill in the details of the status map and then returns. This step ensures that the status map is ready to be populated with the necessary data.

# [Populating the status map](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/t4ea8fl6#populatestatus)

The populateStatus function takes a status map and a configuration object as parameters. It retrieves hostname statistics and metadata, converts them into a suitable format, and adds them to the status map. This step ensures that the status map contains all the necessary hostname and metadata information, which is crucial for accurate monitoring and analysis.

# [Retrieving data from the cache](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/t4ea8fl6#getfromcache)

The GetFromCache function attempts to retrieve the payload from the cache. If the payload is not found in the cache, it calls another function to create a new payload. This step ensures that the metadata reporting always grabs fresh data, while other uses can rely on cached data. This is important for maintaining the accuracy and freshness of the data in the status map.

# [Building a metadata payload](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/t4ea8fl6#getpayload)

The GetPayload function builds a metadata payload every time it is called. It collects various pieces of data, such as hostname, system stats, and network metadata, and constructs a Payload object. This function also caches the metadata for use in other payloads, ensuring that the data is readily available for subsequent requests. This step is crucial for ensuring that the status map is populated with comprehensive and up-to-date metadata.
