---
This document will cover the process of properly shutting down the Datadog Agent's network components, which includes:

1. Stopping active processes
2. Purging the cache
3. Closing the exit channel.

# [Stopping Active Processes](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/8y6wyx8p#close)

The first step in the shutdown process is to stop any active processes. This includes stopping the consumer and the compact ticker. The consumer is responsible for processing data, and the compact ticker helps in managing the timing of these processes. Stopping these ensures that no new data is being processed and that the system is in a stable state before proceeding to the next steps.

# [Purging the Cache](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/8y6wyx8p#purge)

After stopping the active processes, the next step is to purge the cache. The cache stores temporary data that is used by the system for quick access. Purging the cache involves clearing out this temporary data to ensure that no stale or outdated information is left behind. This step is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the system and ensuring that it can start fresh the next time it is initialized.

# [Closing the Exit Channel](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/8y6wyx8p#close)

The final step in the shutdown process is to close the exit channel. The exit channel is a communication pathway that allows different parts of the system to signal that they are shutting down. Closing this channel ensures that all parts of the system are aware that the shutdown process is complete and that no background processes are left running. This step is essential for ensuring a clean and orderly shutdown of the system.
