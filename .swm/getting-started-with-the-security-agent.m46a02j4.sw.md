# Introduction

The Security Agent is responsible for running compliance and runtime security checks. It is configured through the <SwmPath>[test/new-e2e/tests/agent-shared-components/config-refresh/fixtures/security-agent.yaml](test/new-e2e/tests/agent-shared-components/config-refresh/fixtures/security-agent.yaml)</SwmPath> file, which is merged with the main <SwmPath>[pkg/util/scrubber/test/datadog.yaml](pkg/util/scrubber/test/datadog.yaml)</SwmPath> configuration file.

# Commands

The Security Agent commands are defined using the `cobra` library, which provides a simple interface for creating CLI applications. The `SecurityAgentCommands` function returns the security agent commands, including compliance checks and other security-related functionalities.
