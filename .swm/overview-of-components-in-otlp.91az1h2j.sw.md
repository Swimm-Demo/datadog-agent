# Overview of Components in Otlp

Components encapsulate specific pieces of logic or features and provide clear and documented interfaces. They hide the complexity of their implementation from users, ensuring that the internal workings are not exposed. Components are designed to be reusable in different contexts and binaries, making them versatile and adaptable. Each component must be tested to ensure reliability and functionality. If applicable, components should expose a mock implementation to facilitate testing. Ownership of a component is assigned to a single team, which is responsible for its support and maintenance. Changes within a component that do not alter its interface should not require quality assurance from other components that use it.

## Using Components

Using components within other components is covered on the create components page. One of the core ideas behind component design is to be able to create new binaries for customers by aggregating components.

## Using Plain Data Types with Fx

As your migration to components is not finished, you might need to manually instruct Fx on how to use plain types. You will need to use `fx.Supply` for this.

The <SwmToken path="comp/otelcol/otlp/components/statsprocessor/agent.go" pos="107:2:2" line-data="// Start starts the traceagent, making it ready to ingest spans.">`Start`</SwmToken> method in <SwmToken path="comp/otelcol/otlp/components/statsprocessor/agent.go" pos="107:8:8" line-data="// Start starts the traceagent, making it ready to ingest spans.">`traceagent`</SwmToken> demonstrates how to start a set of minimal components needed to compute stats. This method shows how components are initialized and started within a binary.

```go
// Start starts the traceagent, making it ready to ingest spans.
func (p *TraceAgent) Start() {
	// we don't need to start the full agent, so we only start a set of minimal
	// components needed to compute stats:
	for _, starter := range []interface{ Start() }{
		p.Concentrator,
		p.ClientStatsAggregator,
		// we don't need the samplers' nor the processor's functionalities;
		// but they are used by the agent nevertheless, so they need to be
		// active and functioning.
		p.PrioritySampler,
		p.ErrorsSampler,
		p.NoPrioritySampler,
		p.EventProcessor,
	} {
		starter.Start()
	}
	p.goProcess()
}
