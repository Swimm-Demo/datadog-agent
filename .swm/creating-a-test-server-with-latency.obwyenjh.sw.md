This document will cover the process of creating a test server with latency. We'll cover:

1. Initializing the test server
2. Setting up latency
3. Handling metrics and requests.

# [Initializing the Test Server](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/zrzpubao#newtestserver)

The process begins by initializing a basic test server. This server is designed to handle HTTP requests and is configured to always return an HTTP 200 OK status by default. The server also sets up various counters and maps to track request statuses and responses. This ensures that the server can monitor the number of requests it has seen, accepted, retried, and failed. The URL of the server is made available for testing purposes, allowing users to send requests to it.

# [Setting Up Latency](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/zrzpubao#newtestserverwithlatency)

After initializing the test server, the next step is to introduce a delay for each request to simulate network latency. This is done by configuring the server to introduce a specified latency for each request. This setup is useful for testing how applications handle network delays in a controlled environment. By simulating latency, users can observe the behavior of their applications under different network conditions and make necessary adjustments to improve performance and reliability.

# [Handling Metrics and Requests](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZGF0YWRvZy1hZ2VudCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/zrzpubao#handlemessages)

Once the server is set up with latency, it is configured to handle metrics and requests efficiently. The server initializes various listeners and sets up packet handling to ensure it can process multiple packets concurrently. This involves starting the message handling process, which includes initializing workers and listeners to process incoming packets. The server is also configured to handle packet forwarding, health checks, and debug loops. This setup ensures that the server can handle a high volume of requests and provide accurate metrics for monitoring and analysis.
